might quit
it's the first day of school 
and i think i might quit
cuz the things i've been seeing in here don't make sense
so i packed up my things and i walked thru the door and i'm 
going somewhere else instead
so i chopped down some trees 
and i built a small house 
and i just might be small enough to live in it
then the rain came pouring down 
and it made some cool sounds
and i'll tell you what those sounds said
(said) hello and goodbye
do you feel alright
with the days gone by
i'll never waste my time
i'll never say goodbye
yes i will but i won't say it tonight
so i picked a new character
and i've just chose my shirt
and i'm going to the land of the 2 letter words
on in up at or so, by if to of no it
it's a feeling we can't forget
hello and goodnight
do you feel alriiiight
do you remember the days gone by
do you remember the way that we dreamed we could change our lives
do you feel like changing your mind
it's the first day of school
and i think i might quit
cuz the things that i'm feeling still don't make sense
and i've tried to explain
and it hurts to describe
so i'll sing this song instead
[instrumental melody]
hello and goodbye
do you think i'm dying
do you think i'm going somewhere else this time
do you remember the day we pretended to be every star in the sky
it's the first day of school
but i think might quit
gonna learn some new lessons i won't forget
gonna write them all down in the language of love
and then teach them to everyone
at the airport terminal
at the airport terminal the planes are landing
zzzsh zzzsh zzzsh zzzsh zzzsh zzzsh zzzzzsh
i'm traveling somewhere and it feels fantastic
rolling across the terminal floor
blblbbl blblbb blblb blblb blblbl blblbl *bong*
and the sky's so high
and the ground's so low
and i think i'm dying
but i'm just being born
at the airport terminal the planes are landing
and through the terminal we all shall go
at the airport terminal i feel so unusual
everybody here is having an unusual day
it's 10:24 in an unusual time zone
and i'm feelin fine in an unusual way
and we're going so high
as i'm flying so low
and i'm saying goodbye
to the world i know
at the airport terminal the planes are landing
(and) through the terminal we all can grow
and it's time to let go
but i'm lying down on the terminal floor
and i'm running toward the terminal door
and i'm eating porridge, but i've heated it
for the wrong amount of time
at the airport terminal i feel so imaginative
imagining where all the planes are going
(and) when i'm there i'll imagine where i came from
then i'll imagine my way back home
but it's 8:45 and i'm on the next flight
it's going around the world
then we'll fly through the night til the day becomes bright
until the night returns
when will the night return?
hey
at the airport terminal the planes are landing
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
one day soon we will all be together
until then the terminal carries me through
just did a bad thing
just did a bad thing
i regret the thing i did
and you're wondering what it is
i'll tell you what i did
i did a bad thing
i'm having a bad day
it's turning into a bad year
all the things i'm supposed to do
and the places i'm supposed to go
are cancelled
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh)
hey, what's the name of this game
and how do you play it?
and how long does it take?
(bing, bong, bay ohhhh)
and how many times is the game going to change? (ahh)
hey, let me out of this place
(and) out into the real world where maybe things can go my way
oh oh oh everything goes my way
oh oh oh everyone knows my name
i'm having a bad dream
i wonder what this bad dream means
i wonder if i'm sad
i wonder if i'm glad,
or if i'm just having a sad glad dream
it's a sad mad and bad glad dream
[instrumental echo]
and i won't get mad about the dream
if you promise to believe in me
it's a sad bad and mad glad scheme
it's the best scheme i have,
and that's bad enough for me
and i won't get sad if you don't see
just how mad glad my schemes can be
just did a bad thing
i've ruined everything
and i've let the things i've ruined ruin me
hey, what's the name of this game
and how do you play it?
and how long shall it take?
(bing, bong, bay ohhhh)
and how many times is the game supposed to change? (ahh)
hey, get me out of this place
(and) out into the real world where maybe things can go my way
oh oh oh everything goes my way
oh oh oh everything goes astray
just did a strange thing
now everything's pink
christmas isn't real
the easter bunny told me that christmas isn't real
but santa claus is still jesus
the gift giving season is an interesting reason
to make everyone fall in love
ba da dee da da dee do
in a world full of snow
ba da dee da da dee die
with the spirit held up high
ba da dee ba bee yo bing bway-ay
everything feels so alive
for the very first time
the easter bunny gave me some coupons i can use
to buy some love for my valentine
like dumptrucks and diamonds
and roses and walnuts
and gift cards to the diamond store
but those roses and diamonds are all over the floor
and they've got pretty cool prices but i think we can lower it
and if you don't enjoy them we'll let you buy more
at the diamond store
the easter bunny showed me that english isn't real
and the only language is feelings
it's the christmas season and there's gifts on the trees and
the material world is not enough
ba da dee da da dee do
in a world full of drones
ba da dee da da dee die
and i think i can fly
ba da dee ba bee yo bing bway-ay
everything seems so inspired
and i can't seem to fight it
ba da dum di dee dum wow
london bridge is falling down
ba da do di dun dee why
is the west coast on fire
ba da dum dey whey oh dee y hey
everything looks so embrightened
the easter bunny told me that christmas isn't real
but santa claus is still a twitter meme
slow down
look at the time, upon the wall
the clock is tellin it all wrong
you got to slow down
you got to slow down
slow it right off the wall
you got to slow down
my hat     is bent
oh, i got a bent hat
maybe i'll slow down
and straighten it out
and then twist it all around
then put it down
and i'm bobblin down 124th street
and i think i'm bobblin to a brighter day
and the radio's playing a different kind of music
and the universe is starting to shake
look at the time, it's 12;30
i'm going to hell, and i'm late for it
but i'll slow down
and talk about it
and the world goes round and then comes back down
[instrumental verse]
now i'm swingin about my every daily business
and i'm pondering out about how it's daily been
and it's easy to feel if you're useless
but it's strange when you tell your friends
so i re-loaded my fax machine with some fresh clean paper
so i can slow down and have a slow time printing it out
then the roof blew off again and it came back down
and hurricaines and storms cover the landscape
and the picture frames are floating off the wall
and the hourglass is twisting a little bit sideways
and the neighbourhood is all gone
look at the time, on the wall
cuz it's going very very really slowly now
and it's the only thing that anybody ever talks about
and the scientists are always trying to figure out
and the physicists are always letting it bounce around
[1 line inst]
and the novelists are typically writing stories about it
and the journalists are usually breaking news about it
and the pharmacists are frequently making drugs about it
and the charities are always raising money for it
and the client's name is always there
and [client's name] always cares
long long long journey
i remember the moment that my dreams were broken
i wrote them down on a post card and then threw it away
i slipped into some trousers and rolled out my window
then went out into the wilderness where i'm going to stay
and it's a long long long journey that we've been on
and it's a long long long story that can be told
and it's a long long day and we've come a long long way
and it's a long long long way back
i'm looking around this museum for paintings i relate to
even though most of them were painted by somebody else
then we went to the movies and watched lots of films there
now i'm going down to hollywood to make them myself
and it's a long long long journey that we've been on
and it's a long long long story that will be told
and it's a long long day and we've come a long long way
and it's a long long long way back
and it's a big big vehicle that we're driving in
and i've been following this roadway since it began
and if i came here to lose then i still might win
when i go down that road again
and the road doesn't end
it's a long long road and we follow it again and again
and the road don't pretend
i went down to the coast guard to see what they're guarding
see what the sign says you idiot, we're guarding the coast
now i'm going on a podcast to talk about my memories
even though i can't remember anything from before the show
and i made some long long phone calls to my friends at home
and i told them where i've been and the places i'm going
and they said wow that's incredible but we already know
because of that long long song you wrote
about how it's a
long long long journey that we've been on
and it's a long long long story that shall be told
and it's a long long day and we've come a long long way but there's
still a long way to go
it's a long long long way
it's a long long strong way
it's a long long long way
forward
when i get older
when i get older
i'm gonna be stronger
so i can lift up the whole entire world
i'm gonna hold it
and lift it higher
higher than it's been before
when i hear music
i get excited
i'm gonna sing songs to the whole entire world
and when the whole world sings to the music
that's when i'll know it worked
but my friends say i'm still a baby
then they threw away my baby shoes
well excuse me, i'm going sailing
into the ocean blue
when i get older
i'm gonna be wilder
and write poetry in my spare time
and i'll use some very interesting metaphors
and then post my poems online
here's a poem about rain
and the water droplets that it creates
and i wonder if you feel it this way
and i wonder if it seems ok
here's a poem about fame
and the strange things famous people say
and the strange world that hears them say it
almost every single day
when i get older
i'm gonna drive slowly
til i get to all the places i'm going
and when i get there i'm gonna drive backwards
til we get home again
and i'm faced with so many changes
that i just might change my face
but face paint seems a bit tenacious
so i just might paint my brain
when i get younger
i'm gonna be a liar
i'll be lying about being so young
and when i'm older i'll be more truthful
and then lie about singing this song
then the song will sing me
and the song won't sing it for free
and i don't quite know what it means
but it feels like the song knows me
then i'm hearin it in my dreams
and each dream seems pretty sweet
and the music cured my disease
then the song is complete
when i get older
i'm gonna be stronger
so i can lift up the whole entire world
i'm gonna hold it
and lift it higher
then i'll lift it more
the moon is made of cheese
the moon is made of cheese
but i can't taste it
but i like the way the texture feels when i lick the surface
then the rumours start to go round the world that i'm crazy
cuz i can't even taste cheese
but i guess they don't know me
the grass is always green
but i just changed it
to remind me of the way it was when the world was younger
and the TV's on the radio
and the telephone's on the stereo
and the leaves turn to a colorful shade of turquoise
and the birds are made of trees
think i've explained this
and they fly around on an airplane in the business class section
and the ants crawl on the earth's surface
and the turtles roll through the street
and the orchestra's playing symphonies for free
and the church holds the key
the moon is pretty cheap
mount st. helens is about to blow up
Mount St. Helens is about to blow up
and it's gonna be a fine, swell day
everything's gonna fall down to the ground and turn grey
all of my friends, family, and animals
probably going to run away
but me, i'm feeling curious
so i think i just might stay.
the Dow Jones just fell down to zero
and it's gonna be a fine, swell day
and i wonder if it's gonna be as good a day as yesterday
all of these business suits that i've just purchased
gonna have to throw them all away
and slip into something more reasonable
and then dance the night away
i'm riding a pony
into the sunset
everything's green and gold
so i'm not in hell yet
and the people who work in my office went on vacation
cuz they say that i haven't been paying them very much anymore
mount st. helens has a pretty cool gift shop
and i haven't been there in a while
and i've been wondering if it's even still there
and the climate has been changing
and soon it's gonna change more
and we'll figure out all of the details
in climate change court
take a ride on my blimp
oh, it's a very strong blimp
you can watch movies and play games
while riding on it
and when the sun goes down
and the sky burns out
we'll never slow down
oh, we're not going down
mount st. helens is feeling crazy and adventurous
that's the reason that it's so special
and it takes no answers
and it gives no questions
and it makes no excuses
and it really doesn't listen
and it seems so eccentric
and it looks so active
and it dreams of puppies
and it's filled with music
i'm best friends with my own front door
i'm best friends with my own front door
i just closed it, but it's opening more
then the cops came, and they sent me to jail
but tomorrow i'm gonna open it again
i'm the post man and i've got cool clothes
i'm the neighbours and i'm wearing cool shoes
and i'm dreaming of a brand new world
and i'm hoping that it comes real soon
but i saw a sign
i saw the sign
it's a bad, bad, sign
said it's not gonna happen
and it's not what it seems
you're not gonna make it
and it's not meant to be
but f*k them, i just climbed a huge mountain
but everyone told me i couldn't do it
and i feel real nice
cuz i got lots of money in my bank account
and i walk down the street
people throw things at me
like breakfast, and strength tests
(oh this is cool)
how much can i bench press?
(oh, i'm very strong)
time to win some awards
i'm gonna do everything that you're not supposed to do
i'm gonna open to page 1 and then skip ahead to page 2
cuz i'm hungry and scared and i can't find the truth
so i'm leaving
oh, there's my balloon
over the trees, under the bridge, and over the town
i'm gonna tell you the things that i'm feeling out loud
and they changed all the rules then i wrote them all again
that's how the game begins
oh, that's how i get home again
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
i'm finally on my way
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
today's a brand new day
and the sky's so blue
i don't know what to do
and the sky's so grey
i don't know what to say
and we sing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
love is here to stay
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
praise the god damn day
and i can't go on

and i can't go back
if i know where i'm at
and we sing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
hallelujah
hallelujah

and it's time for us to shine
and it's time to make things right
oh, i live in silence and watch the clouds roll by and
try to make sense of each passing day
though i'm not alone, i still
feel all alone, as i'm
living in this lonely country
oh, in 1989 things changed,
and the world realized it's okay to turn the page
but what does that mean,
and does it involve me?
cuz it's time for us to shine
and it's time to make things right
[synth solo]
i am a mime, and i live inside a box
but you know that the walls isn't really there
one day i'll escape like the ghost of kurt cobain
and i'll sing about the way it used to be
life goes by as i look to the sky and scream
oh it's been about 100 years
since we all began hurriedly doing our thing
and we were almost there in the 60's but there was just
one thing left do do
'twas to give birth to me and you
oh, the 70's are dead and gone
and the 80's was just a waste of terrible news
then you and i was born, and we wanted something more
and it's time for us to shine
and it's time to make things right

i can feel the hearts and minds of millions of strong individuals ready to explore
breathe
dream
i can feel the clock tick
and it feels like dynamite in my hands
and i feel like some of us have been waiting our whole lives to understand
so pull the curtain
pull the curtain on this shit
just pull the curtain

about where we stand
lightning strikes
all of us twice
in a lifetime
why can't it be at the same time?
and it only happens every thousand years
so crawl under the bridge
and make yourself a wish
get it under your skin

[melody]
let me call you back
the song song
yo
this is a studio
metropolitan avenue at lorimer street, yeah
sunny day
well i got three months to write a song
to write a song for you
and i'm gonna take my time and say
exactly what i mean
damn, it seems like writing songs is
a lot like being in prison
then i realize that the only one who
put me there is me
got to break free
i need to break free
but i always change my mind again
and then i'm left behind
oh i wish that i could make up my mind this time
but my brain is still in black and white
oh i think i've used this melody
one thousand times before
and the worst part is that i'm not sure
if i'm the one who wrote it
i probably stole it from some song
my mommy used to sing me
or maybe it's just something
off the radio or t.v.
i got to break free
i need to break free
cause i cannot take the pain of
being locked up this way
one day you'll find me in paradise
i'll be saying what i need to say
one more time
say anything you want, and just
do anything you mean
do anything you mean
anything you need to
do anything you need
do anything you mean
please, please
got to break free
i've so got to breathe
but i always lose my mind
and then i'm standing in line
i can't remember the last time i
truly said what was on my mind
and i don't mean to waste your time
i wish that i could truly break free some time
but freedom is hard to find
freedom's hard to find
baby i'm trying
baby i think i'm dying
stuck in a rut
i'm stuck in a rut
